# About  
This is a quiz made in AJAX during my first year at the Linnaeus University.
This application taught me how AJAX works aswell as learning me the basics of JavaScript, as this was in one of the first courses I took.
  
I am unsure if the code is currently runable, if so, you must use the vagrantfile that is included and access the quiz via localhost.
If you wish to test the application itself here are some steps:
1. Pull the repo to your local computer.
2. Make sure you have vagrant installed, then start the virtual machine using `vagrant up` using a terminal that is in the repo-directory.
3. Wait for the vagrant to finish starting up (May take up to 10 minutes on the first time)
4. Use `vagrant ssh` to connect to the VM.
5. Make sure that you're located in the directory `/vagrant/examination/`
6. Type `npm run debug`
7. If message says all clear, go to `http://localhost:4000`
